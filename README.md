# About The Project:

In these projects, we built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allow users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations to attend events.

# Built With:

Ruby On Rails.

# Getting Started With The Project:

1.  Model the data for your application, including the necessary tables.

2.  Create a new Rails application and Git repo called private-events. Update your README.

3.  Build and migrate your User model.

4.  Create a simple Users controller and corresponding routes for #new, #create, and #show actions.

5.  Create a simple sign in function that doesn’t require a password – just enter the ID or name of the user you’d like to “sign in” as and click Okay.

6.  You can then save the ID of the “signed in” user in either the session hash or the cookies hash and retrieve it when necessary.

7.  Get more on the getting started [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations)
